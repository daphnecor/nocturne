"""Run and visualize random policy in nocturne.
- Does the random sometimes exhibit desired behavior?
- If the random policy sometimes does the right thing, then there is a high
chance that RL is going to work because all policy gradients methods do is 
make the good behaviors more likely. So we'll gradually hone in on the good
behaviors.
- Whereas, if agents never stumble on the right thing to do we're never getting 
any signal of what a good behavior looks like.
